    Active Speaker is the most dominant speaker among users. In a room of 10
    users, where each user has his camera on, it may get confusing, when each of
    them, is speaking. Therefore, in order to keep a room communication proper,
    one has to figure out users who are passive speakers, and mute them. Or, you
    could highlight the active speaker, with a border, so that users know a user
    is speaking.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is advised to keep producers (users with camera/mic on) count below 6,
    cause if it increases, then each user would have download 6 video streams
    which would require huge bandwidth, and end users could have performance
    lag.
  </p>
  <p>You could pause producers, when,</p>
  <ul>
    <li>their chance of speaking is over,</li>
    <li>they go silent,</li>
    <li>Consumers handled by each user is greater than 12,</li>
  </ul>
